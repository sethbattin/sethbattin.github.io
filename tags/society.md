# Society

This is the word we use when we don't want to use the p-word.  But spoilers,
politics and society are the same thing.  If you ban folks from talkign about 
politics, you're forbidding them from expressing care about the world they live
in.  Don't be a jerk that way.

Anyway here are some articles where I say what I think about living in a world
that has other people in it.
