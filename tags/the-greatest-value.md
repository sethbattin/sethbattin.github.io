# The-Greatest-Value

This topic is fun because it was almost the whole theme of this very blog.  But
eventually I realized I didn't want to soley write articles in this style.  I 
explained the personal etymology of it in [cooperation-greatest-value], which
is linked below.

tl;dr when i was a highschool debater, a lot of argument cases were framed with
something as "...the greatest value", and then you would use that structure to
argue about whatever.  It was pretty weird, but competative debate was often
divorced from reality.

One thing I did learn though: you don't debate to convince your opponent.  You
debate to convince by-standers.  That's what Abraham Lincoln did, and that's 
why my style of debate was named after him (and the guy he beat).
