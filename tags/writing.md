# Writing

Posts about writing.  Hopefully it's not all navel-gazy blogging junk.  It might
be.

I really like writing as a craft and a hobby.  I want to practice it, and I want
to write down ideas about going about it.  The fact that I do that on a blog is
somewhat beside the point, but the blog exists to facilitate writing practice.
