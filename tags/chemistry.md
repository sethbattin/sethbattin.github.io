# Chemistry

My personal favorite [science](/tag/science/).  I have dearly loved it since I
was young, and my only true regret might be that I didn't pursue it to a higher
degree.  But I had a terrible first teacher in college as a followup to one of
the most amazing teachers on the planet in highschool.  Also I was busy
with...other things in college.

Plus i'm a grownup now, I have enough money to live, and I can do more or less
whatever chemistry I want.  Assuming I can convince my wife it will be safe to
perform around the children.
