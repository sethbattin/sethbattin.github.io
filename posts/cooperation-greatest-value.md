Cooperation is the Greatest Value
=================================

This is my first attempt at a format of essay inspired by my long-gone glory
days as a high-school speech contestant.  "X is the greatest value" is the
pattern by which all Lincoln-Douglas debates argued for and against some line
of moral judgement about society.  I recall "the possession of nuclear weapons
is immoral" was one topic.  I don't have any particular topic to frame my
writing here, I just want to express my appreciation for cooperation as a
concept.

Being a [the greatest value] is clearly hyperbole, even before I write more
than one article using the superlative.  True greatestness was never the idiom,
but rather a way to express that this value should be used as an ethical rubric.
When another quality or virtue suggests a different decision, the titular value
should be chosen instead.  It's a thing that should be pursued along a general 
course of behavior.  It's just intrinsically a good thing.  That's what I'm
going for here.

That's all.  It's something very, very valuable.  Priceless, even.  My dialect
of English has an idiom for that.

Worth its weight in gold
------------------------

[<img src="./antique-fire-extinguisher.jpg" width=300 style="float: left; margin: 1rem;" />][img-fire-extinguisher]This
is an antique fire extinguisher.  I was fortunate enough to encounter it
in my daily life, recognize it for what it was, and be granted it as a gift 
from its rightful owner.  I informed them to the best of my ability what it was
and why I wanted it.  I even included that it was valuable purely as an old
trinket, a historical artifact.  They merely told me that if I sold it, I could
share the proceeds.

It turns out I didn't know how valuable it was.

This device contains carbont etracloride.  It's a simple molecule, and very
similar structurally to another very common chemical, methane.  One carbon atom
with each of its four electron pairs occupied by one other atom.  In CH4's case,
those four atoms are hydrogen.  For carbon-tet, CCl4, the four are chlorines.

It's nonpolar, it's liquid, it's volatile.  Its complete lack of hydrogen and
oxygen mean it doesn't burn in normal conditions, hence the usage as a thing to
be sprayed onto flames in order to snuff them out.  It's a useful solvent for
some acts of chemistry.  Anecdotally it's good at cleaning things.  I don't
know if it is useful to synthesize illegal substances, and I'm not very
interested in finding out.  I knew all that ahead of time and spotted it because
I had seen a couple [interesting bits of media on the subject][x-and-f-carbon-tet]
of acquiring the chemical in exactly this form.

Those media also taught me that it was difficult to obtain otherwise.  When I
say difficult, I mean it is almost impossible to find in any form other than
inside forgotten, reconstruction-era fire extinguishers. Some very special
chemists, or [modern day monarchs](/exceptional-billionaires/), might be able
to acquire it, but only at great cost (relative to a non-monarch). This fluid
has been systematically banned and all usage ceased.  With some minor regional
variation, it ranges between only available to the elite few, and being 100%
illegal to acquire, sell, transport, or manufacture.  So if you want to buy 
some and you happen to live in a place where that's not prison-worthy, at best
you'll be paying out the nose for it.

<details><summary>In fact...</summary>

CCl4's price is about sixty dollars per gram.  That is right about gold's price
when I write this article (its price having stabilized there after climbing
steadily during the prior United States presidental administration).  It is,
in the literal sense of the word literally, literally worth its weight in gold.

The device in my picture weighs almost 1300 grams. The frayed label (not the
one that says "national safety award 195-", but the usage instructions) reads
"not more than 25% carbon tetrachloride".  And obviously the container has some
mass; i'll guess half a kilogram.  So here's my estimate:

| | |
| ---: | ---: |
| Total mass | 1300g |
| less estimated 500g canister | -500g |
| -75% other fluid mass | -600g |
| | |
| estimated CCl4 mass | **200g** |
| 60 dollars per gram | x 60$/g |
| **Total** | **$12,000** |

Even if I can distill only half of that, it will still be the most valuable
single item in my entire house that isn't an electric car.  It'll make a fine
inagural trophy for the adult hobby chemistry set I intend to assemble.  I'll
probably practice distilling something safer first, and I want to make a
Breaking Bad coffee aparatus (even though [apparently that's a commidity][syphon-coffee-maker]).
But after that...I'm definitely distilling this hepatoxin and putting it into
a nice case.

Pretty clear why it's so expensive.  Why was it banned at all?

World Peak Cooperation
----------------------

Yeah this stuff is bad for more than just fires and mice livers.  It also wrecks
havok on the ozone layer.  This is one of those chemicals that only the most 
ancient millenials will remember as being a chloro-floro-carbon, a.k.a. a "CFC".
This one just happens to have zero floros.  So it was banned to fix the hole in
the ozone layer.  Everybody (cooperatively) played by the rules; disaster
averted.  Hurrah!

Hold up; why would only a specific generation remember that?  Aren't generations
a bullshit way to characterize cultural differences as some kind of socially 
acceptable ageism?  Why yes, that [is what generation labels do][the-bs-generation], 
but in this case I think the generation might actually be universal across the
entire world.

[The Montreal Protocol][montreal-protocol] was a conference of every country
collectively agreeing that we needed to stop the production of chemicals that
would inevitibly cause a very real, very bad problem for every living thing on
planet Earth.  Pretty awesome treaty, good job cooperation, you literally saved
the planet.  Greatest value indeed.

Ok but the generation question again...wouldn't older generations also remember
that we saved the planet?  They certainly talk a lot about other stuff that
happened so long ago nobody remembers any more, and they love to lord their
sacrafices over the younger folks on the downstream end of decades of wage
stagnation.  Why don't they remember and brag about this achievement?

Let's get back to that further down.  First, an interlude for my personal
investment in this greatest value.

My quest for cooperation
------------------------

I've spent most of the last year of my life telling anyone who would listen,
and a fair number of folks who didn't, that I needed a supportive team.  I did
not feel heard.  

I had been hired to an explicitly leadership-centric engineering position.  I 
did it the best I could, and I genuinely think I did a decent job teaching a
bunch of folks how to work better and accomplish more.  And I got many venues
to pitch ideas about how we could all work together better.  I just didn't
get those chances within my own team.  If the chances happened, they were
invisible or unusable for me.  I did not feel supported.

At one point a leader told me (I had complained) that they would expect me to
not be stopped by a teammate's lack of support.  I found it wild that I should
have to overcome the barriers put up by _a teammate_.  If teammate wasn't meant
to help me achieve my goals, what the hell were they supposed to do?  That
complainee was a big fan of unilateral decisions; consequences be damned.  I
guess my leader thought that was correct.  It was tough to feel respected by
someone who apparently thinks telling people exactly what to do is the correct
MO.

I have zero interest in commanding people to do specific things that they don't
want to do.  As one excellent manager once told me, "if your goal in management
is to have people obliged to do what you say, then you should never become a
manager."  Well, I do not want to become a manager at all, and I definitely
don't want to ever have authority to make anyone do anything they don't think is correct.

I think leadership is a matter of informed-consent pursuasion that my ideas are
the best ideas.  When I'm wrong, I expect people to be allowed to tell me.  God
I hope they would, anyway.  I'm not guaranteed to succeed at pursuading, and
some folks will always operate in bad faith to block me even when I'm doing it
the best I can.  But I am not willing to fight fight with fire when it comes to
dishonest folks who refuse to listen to others.

When it comes to teammates though, I do have a baseline expectation.  And it's
that they'll try to help me accomplish my goals, because we have the same goals.
If that's not true, then we aren't really on a team at all.  We're just some
folks who get together to try to play some zero-sum game that everyone loses.
I hate that.

I have failed interviews for lack of being able to say what "I" did.  I always
cite my team.  I haven't accomplished anything without the help of other folks.
I never want to claim I accomplished something entirely on my own.  That feels
lonely.  I'm glad I didn't get those jobs that expect me to be an individual
instead of someone who cooperates.

I'm doing better now on my current team.  But it's been a long road getting to
a point where I feel like I can accomplish anything.  I'm still not sure my
company respects the kind of leadership I want to express.

Who could disagree?
-------------------

Ah, back to the generation that should be old enough to remember halting the 
death of the ozone (btw it blocks lethal radiation from space)...wouldn't they
recall what a CFC was?  And be very happy about it?

No, they won't mention it. Because somehow this event has been turned into a
propaganda piece against cooperation.  I wish I was joking.

I have been told, with 100% sincerity, that the ozone hole was a clear example
of science making a mountain out of a mole-hill.  "We all heard about how this
big ozone problem was coming, and then it didn't arrive.  So clearly," they 
claimed emphatically, "the problem never existed in the first place!"  They 
further argued that in general a scientist's histrionics should be ignored.
Of course this conversation was about their lack of belief in global warming.

This person took the absence of a terrible consequence, which happened due to
unprecedented cooperation, as evidence that we should not cooperate to solve
the next climate crisis.  And God help us all, they aren't alone.  

Just to be explicit, carbon dioxide can be categorically proven to be a 
greenhouse gas (so is methane), using exactly the same science as the CFC. That
science being chemistry.  All the same quantum mechanics (that's how chemistry
works), other physics, and math, they are all undeniable.  The source of CO2
atmospheric concentraion changes are also clear, undeniably a result of human
action over the last two centuries.  And the impacts of increased
temperatures...suffice to say those models are pretty scientific too, folks.

So what to say to that uncle of yours who thinks "weathermen can't even predict
rain, so why listen to them about a little heat?"  Tell him those weathermen
already saved all our asses within the last generation.  And they're begging
to save it again, we only need to listen and cooperate.  Let them lead us with
honestly and facts, and not fight them with propaganda.

I think the reason older generations don't brag is because the world did it
together.  And losers who want to do things all by themselves can't respect
folks who cooperate.  Don't be a loser.  Cooperate and save the world.


Future of Coop
--------------

As the world marches ~blindly~ strongly ahead (undecidedly between forward to
World War 3 or backward to the Cold War), we need cooperation more than ever.
And the hypercapitalist nee communist country wants to piss off the 
still-pretty-capitalist nee slave-economy country, but no one wants to address
the important problems.  I sure hope that changes.

That whole other looming ecological disaster that can only be solved by
cooperative action was also a debate topic.  "The US should establish a policy
to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels."  Most of the conversation was about
global warming, of course.  Imagine a bunch of highschool freshman arguing with
each other for sport, taking turns as the scientists pleading for reason,
versus the oil company pitching exactly the same deception as the tobacco
companies 30 years earlier.  That was highschool debate.  I'd much rather just
pick a value and advocate for it.

By the way we were reading sources from 1992 that said there wasn't clear
evidence about global warming yeah.  It was a lie, of course, again this is
disinformation technique was invented by the tobacco industry.  But that debate
tactic worked pretty well; maybe we just need to sit and wait for a few (tens
of ) years. Well here we are three decades later, and we still haven't gathered
enough evidence for these bad-faith non-cooperaters.  We never will convince
them, because they don't want to be convinced.  It's time to fire those bad
teammates and get onto team save-the-world.
