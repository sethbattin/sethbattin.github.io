Blog Under Construction: Part 3
===============================

The bulk of my post-holiday staycation has been gone toward spinning up this:
blog.  I'm quite happy about that so far.  It was sandiwched among multiple 
family birthdays and other positive life events, but still stands out.  I 
think I love writing as much as I imagined I would one upon a time in grade
school.

So why haven't I actually written anything for two weeks?

I also love programming
-----------------------

I was personally attacked on twitter:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" > 
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">
happy new year to all the engineers who have resolved to write more but 
decided they need to build a blogging platform first</p>

</blockquote> 

Yes, I did this.  Though in my defense I started this project in March of 2021.
I wasn't joking that mustering will for projects is difficult.  Furthermore I
did not actually skip writing.  I've been writing in various forms non-stop.
Before writing this article, I spent some time collating my various drafts 
across mutliple computers and mobile devices.  I've journalled relentlessly on
my wonderful, beloved [reMarkable tablet](https://remarkable.com/).

I just also like programming a whole lot.  Of all the brilliant luck in my life,
my ability to actually enjoy computer programming enough to do it for a living
_and_ a hobby is pretty high up there.

Possibly because of the depth of my ability to practice this skill, I also put
a personal premium on craftsmanship when I do things on computers.  I want to
not just...do things, but do them as well as I possibly can, in exactly the way
I feel it should be done.  I get plenty of opportunity to compromise on that
value during my profressional life.  Plying my trade to advance commerce is bad
enough in the abstract, but advancing business goals often means doing low-
quality work that happens to maximize business value.

So when I have no master but myself, I like to build slowly and carefully.  
That is why I am building a platform that works how I want it to.  And where it
does not yet work how I'd like, I leave open the option to improve it in the 
future.

But...the writing
-----------------
I claim to have myriad drafts and topics and loose concepts for structures of
articles and information.  Put up or shut up, right?  Why aren't they published
already?

I've noticed an interesting form of mental stalemate: I want there to be lots
of content surrounding the content.  I want to hold back publishing "good" 
articles until I have a good ballast of so-so articles.  I want to have a good
things to see before I show off anything at all.  I don't want to waste my 
brilliant ideas on flightly visitors; I want them to see a backlog and be 
hungry for more.  Like Eminem planning his release of [My Name Is](my-name-is)
I have strategic targets in mind; I can't simply plop out posts willy-nilly.

I also want the thing to not look like shit.  I've had to figure out enough
css to make it presentable.

So of course over the last few days I've re-made the mistakes of a million 
bloggers before me and re-invented the wheel.  It's not an accident that I've 
named this article Part-3 when parts 1 and 2 don't yet exist; it's that the 
previous were too ill-formed to write even if they happened chronologically 
sooner.  This article's ideas are easier to blurt out.  Those earlier parts
will eventually describe the work I've done _not_ writing in more detail.  In
the meantime this is what I can produce.

Who cares
---------
Why is this even a problem?  I don't have anyone in mind for reading this.  I'm
typing it in [a public code repository (under construction part 1)](/under-construction-1)
with [a few non-public exceptions](/under-construction-2).  So I'm both not 
presenting it to anyone and not hiding it from anyone.  

The answer is that I want what I write here to have value.  And because of that
idea of craftsmanship, I want it to have maximal value.  That desire to do a 
great job certainly does slow down my ability to produce at a rapid, laissez-
faire manner.  And yet at the same time, the whole point of all this work is to
be able to write with as little friction as possible.

I think I've managed to navigate this catch-22.  Between the rest period of 
time off from work, the freedom to build the system I want, and the early 
success with building a system that lets me write, I am off to a good start.  I
now only need to keep up my own momentum (a classically difficult aspect to 
forming a new habit, but probably not harder than [quitting smoking](/quitting-smoking)).

This blog brings me value even if I never succeed along any of my long-term 
axes.  I like to have a place to publish; I've been missing that.  Maybe other
folks will find value in it someday as well, maybe not.  But I won't delay my
own enjoyment, or even the act of writing, for those imaginary other readers.
