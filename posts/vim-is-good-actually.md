Whatever, the gist was "modal interfaces already make sense in other scenarios"

examples:
- system-key-press, then {do OS-related stuff}
- modal popups (note also the etymology of "mode")
- in graphical editors, the UX changes by mode.  Lucid chart "stop editing this group" and Unity3d "run mode overlay" (credit Tom Francis)
