Engineer, review Thyself
========================

I need to write this article to fulfill my employment contract.  I am trying to
take that obligation seriously.

That intro seems daunting to fulfill.  But there's only one way to succeed, and
that's to start.  Yolo.

Prior Employment
----------------

My previous job was a real mixed bag.  I have pages and pages of hand-written
notes to help me remember the beauty and the horror.  I made a few friends, but
gained many more neutral contacts, including a few enemies.  I accomplished a
great deal, but much less than I could have.

To say I was burned out would be a severe understatement.  I spent more effort
trying to retain my sanity than actually accomplishing my ostensible job of
writing software for the place.

The company is no longer existent.  I was one of a first wave of layoffs, and
but a scant few months later, the entire subdivision of the parent company was
simply wiped off of the ledger.  I have never experienced that first hand.  I
guess I still haven't, since I was gone before it occurred during my tenure.

All I can say about that place is: I am grateful it ended.  Being surprised
retired sucks, but I felt joy when I got the news.  I'm pretty sure that means
it was a good thing to leave behind.

Severance
---------

Lucky me, my layoff came with a full four weeks of salary.  Obviously that is a
pittance compared to continuing to be contracted full-time, but it's better than
a "thank you and good luck".

It sucked further because I had just begun a process to attempt to go on medical
leave.  I felt my mental health was so poor that I essentially couldn't work.
I needed a break, and ideally that break would come with the option to resume
laboring if I so chose.  Sadly, the medical community failed me on this one.  I
was broken in mind, in need of stress relief, and suddenly hopping from an
employed frying pan to an unemployed fire.  I still don't know which stress
source was worse, but it would have been nice to keep my routine intact.

So in Fall of that year I job hunted like my whole family depended on it
(because they did).  Fall came and went, and I concluded that I had very low
chances of being hired during the coming holidays and Winter.

I chose to accept that circumstance and focus on stress relief.  I lived my life
as if I did not need to labor in order to maintain a roof over heads and meals
into bellies.  That was probably foolish; at the time I believed I was losing
very little in terms of job hunt results.

The severance was long gone, but luckily my home had its savings accounts.  We
burned those up.  More lucky, a wealthy-ish close relative took pity.  She
gifted the maximum legal tax-less amount and expected nothing in return.  No harm
done except to my own ego.

I started the new year, winter-ish though it was, job hunting in earnest.  It was
intensely demoralizing.  Everyone was terrified of the incoming presidential
administration and the economic disasters it was likely to incur.  This was the
year 2025, in case that detail matters to you.  At least I was getting
interviews finally.  That was better than the prior season.

I got interviews and failed them.  Some failed fast, some failed slow.  Some
failed without me ever knowing because the opportunity providers didn't even
deign to respond to my inquiries.  I missed out on opportunities that sounded
interesting and challenging.  But such is the life of an unwillingly unemployed
citizen of our [#society].

Stress Relief
-------------

My mental health was at an all time low.  I swallowed the last bit of unbroken
ego I could find and asked for help via social media ([www.LinkedIn.com]), which
sucks, but in this case I owe it a great deal.  I got at least three bites from
my silly little "looking for work" post.

And of those three, the third one turned into a job offer.  I was referred, I
passed the interviews (too many to count), and received an offer in April.  I
began work in May.

The pay was modest compared to my history, and my household wasn't certain it
was enough.  But it was better than zero and included health insurance.  Praise
the Lord.

Summer 2025
-----------

Society as a whole was running wild, but I had finally found my way out of the
unemployment labyrinth.  I had a job to do.

I _knew_ I was joining a team that uses so-called "ruby on rails".  I also knew
Ruby syntax in the vaguest sense; the fact that it emphasized DRY programming
and object-orientation and used some weird symbols that were atypical among
other languages.  Just absolutely *RIPE* with syntactic sugar.  I also knew
rails was full of "meta-programming" in a way that made everything easier if you
know what was truly happening between code and execution.  Big "if", that.

I knew that my team (not yet formed) was aware of my modest understanding of
these core details about my skill.  My boss said "give yourself some grace"
every time I apologized for working slowly.

I have always been a slow programmer.  Speak softly, carry big stick.  For me it
was more like "carry a sharp scalpel, use it sparingly".  Eventually I learned
how the systems worked.  *WHY* they worked.  Whom I could ask for assistance
when I was stuck.

Did I mention this system had a decade of developmental cruft?  Many major
versions and the transitional code between them?  Also that one of the primary
developers was leaving the company, and the one who knew second-most about the
system was exactly the person I was replacing?  On a team that momentarily did
not exist?

Another fun set of details: I felt like the slow person on a team composed of
one newlywed and one new-parent.  I've been in both those situations...the fact
that my team produced any code whatsoever was a miracle.  I can't recall what we
worked on, but I am pretty sure we got it done.

Fall 2025
---------

For the most part, calendar seasons at my company correlate with fiscal
quarters.  For me, Fall implies that the children go back to school so I have a
modicum of privacy and focus at my home office.  Of course I still had two dogs
and four cats, plus a spouse, but in general Fall increases my ability to get
work done.  Whether that was strictly true in the year 2025AD...I am still
uncertain.

In terms of work planning, all engineers and engineering managers agreed that we
absolutely _SHOULD NOT_ work on one specific project.  We estimated it as
extremely high effort.  We carefully measured what functionality we were
estimating.  We knew we had other, smaller priorities to accomplish.  We did
absolutely everything in our power to simply say "no" to working on this
project.  For brevity, we should refer to this project simply as "Q".

Q was one of those things that we knew customers wanted.  And more importantly,
every person at our company knew it was highly-demanded, including the full
executive chain.  Of course customers wanted it; it was perfectly matched with
our customer base and their business scope, etc. etc. 

But we just couldn't fit it in.  We wanted to finish the things we agreed to
work on.  We could not promise to work on this project during this Fall quarter.
Simply too big.

At the very next sprint planning, we decided to work on it anyway.  In this
context, "sprint planning" means the thing we do every couple weeks.  So a
quarter contains roughly six of those.  At least a quarter theoretically _could_
contain 6 of them, if you assume there are zero holidays and personal time.
This quarter did not fit those criteria, given that it contains Halloween,
Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's A, B, and C.  Also my birthday!

So we worked on a project we said we couldn't accomplish, in a timeline that was
extremely limited, with a borderline skeleton crew.  Project Q was also barely
defined...but that turned out to be a good thing.  So good that it helped us
finish early.

If you can't finish one whole project in one almost-whole season, there's an easy
answer.  Finish half a project in half a season.  That's what we did, and that's
how we succeeded.  Huge success.

Personal Problems
-----------------

My spouse is adamant that I suffer from [seasonal affective disorder][SAD].  I
don't really think of it as a disorder though, because I can't fathom how
someone would ever _NOT_ suffer from a Minnesota winter.  We wake up in the
dark, get ready in the dark, start work in the dark.  We finish work eventually,
also in the dark.  The season of Winter suuuuucccckkkkkkssssss.  Toss that [SAD]
into a bag with work stress and holiday expectations, and you have a recipe for
personal struggle on an immense scale.  I struggled to work; no doubt about
that.

Winter of my '43
----------------

Because the season of winter crosses two calendar years, I try to think of them
in terms of my birthday.  I became 43 years old officially this season.  My
employment is in doubt, be it from [#society], or from local
[#politics][/tag/society], or from [#personal] problems.  I know I have work to
do in many different areas of my life, and there are only so many hours in the
day.  I have to pick and choose how I spend my precious time on this Earth.  I
just wish I had more to spend.
