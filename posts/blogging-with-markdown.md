# BLogging with markdown
It should be easier than this.  Dare I say that was the whole point.

I will contradict myself almost immediately.  When computers are simple to use, it means someone somewhere spent time making all the complexity invisible.  Usually many, many people over a very long time.  I wanted a system for blogging that was easy to use, but I had not yet invested the effort to make it so.  If you are reading this, I will assume I was eventually successful.  At the time of writing I only have failures to report.

## Failures are the most useful information

To gain expertise, to learn any skill, is partly a matter of learning how to do something correctly.  But if that were the natural outcome of trying, then no learning would be required and the skill would have no value.  

The real learning is in knowing what to avoid.  I hope to list here a long set of failures that might help someone else gain skill faster than I did.

## The choices made for us

I started with the ideas I _should_ have understood well.

shorthand notes:

javascript and nextjs
 - i don't really care about language
 - i do care about tech, for professional reasons
mdxjs
 - prior experience
 - cookie-cutter setup 
setup
 - docs too simple; they hide what's happening
 - data collection by default WTF VERCEL
please no meta-data
 - story of techhub
 - turns out it's common for jeckle too
 - can't i just let the files store the article?
todo:
 - mdx external
 - next-mdx-remote example might do exactly that
