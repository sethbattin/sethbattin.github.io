      <h1 id="society" itemprop="headline">Society</h1>
<p>This is the word we use when we don&#39;t want to use the p-word.  But spoilers,
politics and society are the same thing.  If you ban folks from talkign about 
politics, you&#39;re forbidding them from expressing care about the world they live
in.  Don&#39;t be a jerk that way.</p>
<p>Anyway here are some articles where I say what I think about living in a world
that has other people in it.</p>
