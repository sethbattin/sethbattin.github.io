      <h1 id="the-greatest-value">The-Greatest-Value</h1>
<p>This topic is fun because it was almost the whole theme of this very blog.  But
eventually I realized I didn&#39;t want to soley write articles in this style.  I 
explained the personal etymology of it in <a href="/cooperation-greatest-value/" title="Cooperation is the Greatest Value">cooperation-greatest-value</a>, which
is linked below.</p>
<p>tl;dr when i was a highschool debater, a lot of argument cases were framed with
something as &quot;...the greatest value&quot;, and then you would use that structure to
argue about whatever.  It was pretty weird, but competative debate was often
divorced from reality.</p>
<p>One thing I did learn though: you don&#39;t debate to convince your opponent.  You
debate to convince by-standers.  That&#39;s what Abraham Lincoln did, and that&#39;s 
why my style of debate was named after him (and the guy he beat).</p>
