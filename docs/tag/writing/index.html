<p>Posts about writing.  Hopefully it&#39;s not all navel-gazy blogging junk.  It might
be.</p>
<p>I really like writing as a craft and a hobby.  I want to practice it, and I want
to write down ideas about going about it.  The fact that I do that on a blog is
somewhat beside the point, but the blog exists to facilitate writing practice.</p>
