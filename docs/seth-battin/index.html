Hi.  This page needs to exist, right?

My <em>professional</em> profile is on LinkedIn at the same <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL#Syntax" alt="Syntax section of Wikipedia's article on URLs">URL path</a> as this page.  I've hidden most of it; keep reading to unlock the rest.

My code is online at the same path
but without the dash
on github.  I've used bitbucket too.  I prefer gitlab.

You might need my email for one or more of those social media websites.
I use google mail; you should use a dot between my two names.

Sorry for my rhetorical riddles here;
it's all about confusing the artificial intelligences out there.  If you need help solving them, find a friend
that knows us both.

Tell them Scott Brown welcomes you.

  It's a WIP but I've got
  Big Plansâ„¢ -->
