    <h1>This page is for a 404!</h1>
    <main style="max-width: 400px;">
    <p>That means you found a page that doesn't exist.  That might be your fault,
    or it might be mine!  I add links to articles that I _plan_ to write, but
    let's be honest, there's no guarantee I'm going to write those.</p>
    <p>If you really wanted to read whatever you clicked on to get here, I'm
    sorry.  Maybe send me a reminder to write it via a github issue?  I host
    this page on github pages from a public respository, so you should be free
    to comment.  If you include the page that had the link, that will save me a
    few seconds of searching for it.</p>
    <p>That's the only complaint/comment system I've got. To be honest I
    appreciate anyone who reads this stuff.  My dad started writing only at the
    very twilight of his life, and this is me trying to start sooner. And if
    you want to complain about something more serious, I'll just repeat some of
    his words toward my grandfather: "lay off the kid, will ya?".</p>
