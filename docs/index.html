    <p>Alternate title: from-scratch CSS misadventures in emulating print media; how I
learned to stop worrying and love css columns and flex-box.</p>
<p>After <a href="/under-construction-3/" title="blog under construction part 3 - what audience and why bespoke">being personally attacked</a> about building a blog instead of writing
content for it, I further <del>was dog-piled</del> felt seen by folks noting that it was
equally likely we&#39;d waste our time in style-sheets instead of making the platform.
So, so true.</p>
<p>But now being on the other side of that process, I&#39;m happy to have spent the 
effort.  I like the look and am excited to refine it further.  This article 
will introduce additional items that I need to style, and I&#39;m genuinely looking
forward to it.  Among those new features: the 3rd article on the home page (the
intended maximum number), block-quote-based large text blurbs, aside elements, 
and various inter-linking exercises like categories and prev/next relation links.<br>Huzzah!</p>
<p>I went with a newspaper look.  Early reviews suggest that the attempt was at 
least partially successful.  I broke from web-typical and did not make line 
space between paragraphs.  Instead I added first-line indentation.  That coupled
nicely with a long-time fascination of mine: emulating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminated_manuscript" title="Illuminated manuscripts - Wikipedia">illumination</a>.  I know
I have attempted it in the past and failed, so I was surprised at the easy 
solution in modern css using first-letter pseudo selection.</p>
<p>I know illuminated manuscripts don&#39;t have a direct lineage to modern multi-media,
but I can&#39;t help but notice how similar they are.  The simple act of jazzing up
some writing with a little artistry...that&#39;s what websites are all about, right?
That it&#39;s no longer the sole domain of cloistered practitioners is wonderful.</p>

    <p>The bulk of my post-holiday stay-cation has been gone toward spinning up this
blog.  I&#39;m quite happy about that so far.  It was sandwiched among multiple 
family birthdays and other positive life events, but it still stands out.  I 
think I love writing as much as I imagined I would once upon a time in grade
school.</p>
<p>So why haven&#39;t I actually written anything for two weeks?</p>
<p>I was personally attacked on twitter:</p>
<p>Yes, I did this.  Though in my defense I started this project in March of 2021.
I wasn&#39;t joking that <a href="/starting">mustering will for projects</a> is difficult.<br>Furthermore I did not actually skip writing.  I&#39;ve been writing in various 
forms non-stop.  Before writing this article, I spent some time collating my 
various drafts across multiple computers and mobile devices.  I&#39;ve journaled 
relentlessly on my wonderful, beloved <a href="https://remarkable.com/">reMarkable tablet</a>.</p>

    <p>After waiting what feels like most of a lifetime, I finally made progress toward writing and publishing again.  I&#39;ve had the inspiration to start blogging again for a very, very long time, but like all projects in my recent adult life I have lost momentum before even starting.
The idea of writing has bounced around my head for even longer.  It was my first career ambition as a child, even.  That dream fell away in the face of STEM.  I experimented again in college amid my engineering studies, and I enjoyed the exercise a great deal.  But after google-analyzing a visitor that may have been a prospective employer, I thoughtlessly wiped all its contents.  The content was not valuable, but I regret the loss of the activity.
Today, I not only lack desperation to please some fickle interviewer but also seek to share some wisdom from the intervening fifteen years of labor.</p>
