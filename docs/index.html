    <h2>Cooperation is the Greatest Value</h2>

    <p>This is my first attempt at a format of essay inspired by my long-gone glory
days as a high-school speech contestant.  &quot;X is the greatest value&quot; is the
pattern by which all Lincoln-Douglas debates argued for and against some line
of moral judgment about society.  I recall &quot;the possession of nuclear weapons
is immoral&quot; was one topic.  I don&#39;t have any particular topic to frame my
writing here, I just want to express my appreciation for cooperation as a
concept.</p>
<p>Being a <a href="/tag/opinion/the-greatest-value" title="The greatest value(s)">the greatest value</a> is clearly hyperbole, even before I write more
than one article using the superlative.  True greatestness was never the idiom,
but rather a way to express that this value should be used as an ethical rubric.
When another quality or virtue suggests a different decision, the titular value
should be chosen instead.  It&#39;s a thing that should be pursued along a general 
course of behavior.  It&#39;s just intrinsically a good thing.  That&#39;s what I&#39;m
going for here.</p>
<p>That&#39;s all.  It&#39;s something very, very valuable.  Priceless, even.  My dialect
of English has an idiom for that.</p>
<p><a href="/cooperation-greatest-value/antique-fire-extinguisher.jpg" title="Pyrene fire extinguisher, 1950s, containing carbon tetrachloride"><img alt="antique fire extinguisher" 
src="/cooperation-greatest-value/antique-fire-extinguisher.jpg"
width=300 class="inline" /></a>This
is an antique fire extinguisher.  I was fortunate enough to encounter it
in my daily life, recognize it for what it was, and be granted it as a gift 
from its rightful owner.  I informed them to the best of my ability what it was
and why I wanted it.  I even included that it was valuable purely as an old
trinket, a historical artifact.  They merely told me that if I sold it, I could
share the proceeds.</p>

    <p>Alternate title: from-scratch CSS misadventures in emulating print media; how I
learned to stop worrying and love css columns and flex-box.</p>
<p>After <a href="/under-construction-3/" title="blog under construction part 3 - what audience and why bespoke">being personally attacked</a> about building a blog instead of writing
content for it, I further <del>was dog-piled</del> felt seen by folks noting that it was
equally likely we&#39;d waste our time in style-sheets instead of making the platform.
So, so true.</p>
<p>But now being on the other side of that process, I&#39;m happy to have spent the 
effort.  I like the look and am excited to refine it further.  This article 
will introduce additional items that I need to style, and I&#39;m genuinely looking
forward to it.  Among those new features: the 3rd article on the home page (the
intended maximum number), block-quote-based large text blurbs, aside elements, 
and various inter-linking exercises like categories and prev/next relation links.<br>Huzzah!</p>

    <p>The bulk of my post-holiday stay-cation has been gone toward spinning up this
blog.  I&#39;m quite happy about that so far.  It was sandwiched among multiple 
family birthdays and other positive life events, but it still stands out.  I 
think I love writing as much as I imagined I would once upon a time in grade
school.</p>
<p>So why haven&#39;t I actually written anything for two weeks?</p>
<p>I was personally attacked on twitter:</p>
<p>Yes, I did this.  Though in my defense I started this project in March of 2021.
I wasn&#39;t joking that <a href="/starting">mustering will for projects</a> is difficult.<br>Furthermore I did not actually skip writing.  I&#39;ve been writing in various 
forms non-stop.  Before writing this article, I spent some time collating my 
various drafts across multiple computers and mobile devices.  I&#39;ve journaled 
relentlessly on my wonderful, beloved <a href="https://remarkable.com/">reMarkable tablet</a>.</p>
