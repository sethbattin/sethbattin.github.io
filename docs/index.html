    <p>The bulk of my post-holiday stay-cation has been gone toward spinning up this
blog.  I&#39;m quite happy about that so far.  It was sandwiched among multiple 
family birthdays and other positive life events, but it still stands out.  I 
think I love writing as much as I imagined I would once upon a time in grade
school.</p>
<p>So why haven&#39;t I actually written anything for two weeks?</p>
<p>I was personally attacked on twitter:</p>
<p>Yes, I did this.  Though in my defense I started this project in March of 2021.
I wasn&#39;t joking that <a href="/starting">mustering will for projects</a> is difficult.<br>Furthermore I did not actually skip writing.  I&#39;ve been writing in various 
forms non-stop.  Before writing this article, I spent some time collating my 
various drafts across multiple computers and mobile devices.  I&#39;ve journaled 
relentlessly on my wonderful, beloved <a href="https://remarkable.com/">reMarkable tablet</a>.</p>
<p>I just also like programming a whole lot.  Of all the brilliant luck in my life,
my ability to actually enjoy computer programming enough to do it for a living
<em>and</em> a hobby is pretty high up there.</p>
<p>Possibly because of the depth of my ability to practice this skill, I also put
a personal premium on craftsmanship when I do things on computers.  I want to
not just...do things, but do them as well as I possibly can, in exactly the way
I feel it should be done.  I get plenty of opportunity to compromise on that
value during my professional life.  Plying my trade to advance commerce is bad
enough in the abstract, but advancing business goals often means doing low-
quality work that happens to maximize business value.</p>

    <p>After waiting what feels like most of a lifetime, I finally made progress toward writing and publishing again.  I&#39;ve had the inspiration to start blogging again for a very, very long time, but like all projects in my recent adult life I have lost momentum before even starting.
The idea of writing has bounced around my head for even longer.  It was my first career ambition as a child, even.  That dream fell away in the face of STEM.  I experimented again in college amid my engineering studies, and I enjoyed the exercise a great deal.  But after google-analyzing a visitor that may have been a prospective employer, I thoughtlessly wiped all its contents.  The content was not valuable, but I regret the loss of the activity.
Today, I not only lack desperation to please some fickle interviewer but also seek to share some wisdom from the intervening fifteen years of labor.</p>
