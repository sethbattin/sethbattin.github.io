    <h2>The Best Day All Week</h2>

    <p>Best day yet.  I woke at 2:30 EDT, knowing that my sleep schedule was decimated
from sharing a room with three other loud sleepers since Tuesday, while also
trying to squeeze in work activities in the downtime.  But today being Saturday,
there was no risk to failure other than missing some optional activities due to
being tired.  That was fine, so I felt great.</p>
<p>I took my work to the lobby (I had nothing better to do, after all), but the
lobby continued its week of being awful for working.  The hotel&#39;s coffee was
available but not complementary at its in-lobby franchise coffee shop, but it was
closed.  So I went outside and sat on the sidewalk.  I got more work done than I
had the whole previous day.</p>
<p>Eventually I overheard a parked airport cabdriver asking a hotel staff member
when coffee would be available.  I proffered &quot;it opens at 6&quot;, and he challenged
back &quot;that&#39;s late, isn&#39;t it?&quot;.  I said &quot;yeah&quot;.  Since I was also looking for
coffee, I continued talking to the driver as the hotel staff walked away.  It
hadn&#39;t occurred to me that they weren&#39;t having a friendly conversation.</p>
<p>But the driver seemed friendly to me.  I offered to walk for coffee with him,
and he agreed.  We only went far enough to confirm that a different franchise
coffee and donuts place was not yet open.  He almost got hit by another cab
while trying to find info on his phone.  He was jaywalking, so he said &quot;sorry&quot;,
and I said &quot;don&#39;t worry, they saw you.&quot;  He said &quot;yeah, they&#39;re the one with the
horn, not me.&quot;  I liked that line.</p>

    <h2>Under Construction part 1: Blogging with markdown</h2>

    <p>This article mostly aims to collect and recollect my thoughts about writing on
the internet.  How I want to exercise and enjoy the task.  To answer that &quot;how&quot;
question in a single word: &quot;simple&quot;.  I want it to be as easy as sitting down
(<a href="/focus-time/" title="The endless pursuit of the ability to accomplish
anything whatsoever">lol just focus, what&#39;s the problem</a>), typing words, and <a href="https://github.com/sethbattin/sethbattin.github.io/blob/main/INSTALL.md#publishing" title="publishing instructions to myself for this blog">pushing
&quot;publish&quot;</a>.  I think that goal is entirely feasible for a blog
system to provide, for it to both have the benefit of being functional <em>AND</em> not
obstruct me with high-effort, painful chores.</p>
<p>But as a software expert I know that when computers are simple to use, it means
someone somewhere spent time making all the complexity invisible.  Usually many,
many people over a very long time.  I wanted a system for blogging that was
easy, but I had not yet invested the effort to make it so.  If you are reading
this, I will assume I was eventually successful.</p>

    <h2>Cooperation is the Greatest Value</h2>

    <p><span class="update"><a href="#update-march-12-2022" class="update">Updated March 12, 2022</a></span></p>
<p>This is my first attempt at a format of essay inspired by my long-gone glory
days as a high-school speech contestant.  &quot;X is the greatest value&quot; is the
pattern by which all Lincoln-Douglas debates argued for and against some line
of moral judgment about society.  I recall &quot;the possession of nuclear weapons
is immoral&quot; was one topic.  I don&#39;t have any particular topic to frame my
writing here, I just want to express my appreciation for cooperation as a
concept.</p>
<p>Being a <a href="/tag/opinion/the-greatest-value" title="The greatest value(s)">the greatest value</a> is clearly hyperbole, even before I write more
than one article using the superlative.  True greatestness was never the idiom,
but rather a way to express that this value should be used as an ethical rubric.
When another quality or virtue suggests a different decision, the titular value
should be chosen instead.  It&#39;s a thing that should be pursued along a general 
course of behavior.  It&#39;s just intrinsically a good thing.  That&#39;s what I&#39;m
going for here.</p>
