    <h2>Under Construction part 1: Blogging with markdown</h2>

    <p>This article mostly aims to collect and recollect my thoughts about writing on
the internet.  How I want to exercise and enjoy the task.  To answer that &quot;how&quot;
question in a single word: &quot;simple&quot;.  I want it to be as easy as sitting down
(<a href="/focus-time/" title="The endless pursuit of the ability to accomplish
anything whatsoever">lol just focus, what&#39;s the problem</a>), typing words, and <a href="https://github.com/sethbattin/sethbattin.github.io/blob/main/INSTALL.md#publishing" title="publishing instructions to myself for this blog">pushing
&quot;publish&quot;</a>.  I think that goal is entirely feasible for a blog
system to provide, for it to both have the benefit of being functional <em>AND</em> not
obstruct me with high-effort, painful chores.</p>
<p>But as a software expert I know that when computers are simple to use, it means
someone somewhere spent time making all the complexity invisible.  Usually many,
many people over a very long time.  I wanted a system for blogging that was
easy, but I had not yet invested the effort to make it so.  If you are reading
this, I will assume I was eventually successful.</p>
<p>As usual I will try to avoid burying the lede; spoilers, the title is correct.
I chose to type into text files using a format called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" title="Wikipedia: Markdown">markdown</a>.  It is
readable without any post-processing whatsoever.  Because it&#39;s text.  Its
formatting conventions make it somewhat aesthetic too; headings look important,
lists look like lists, and it even makes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext" title="Wikipedia: Hypertext">hypertext</a> look interactive.  And
finally it can be transformed into HTML-proper easily.  Great, perfect choice!</p>
<p>In markdown&#39;s case &quot;easily&quot; is an <a href="/quizzing-is-not-helping/" title="An article about how
colleagues need help and answers, not further struggle for their own good">exercise typically left to the
reader</a>.  Since I didn&#39;t care to literally implement
the specification from scratch, I instead <a href="/homemade-anti-heroes" title="Building from scratch is educational
but not erudite">stood on the shoulders of
giants</a> and
assembled a system from preexisting software.  <a href="#implementation-details">More details
below</a>, or read on for more treatise on the philosophy
of the open internet.</p>

    <h2>Cooperation is the Greatest Value</h2>

    <p>This is my first attempt at a format of essay inspired by my long-gone glory
days as a high-school speech contestant.  &quot;X is the greatest value&quot; is the
pattern by which all Lincoln-Douglas debates argued for and against some line
of moral judgment about society.  I recall &quot;the possession of nuclear weapons
is immoral&quot; was one topic.  I don&#39;t have any particular topic to frame my
writing here, I just want to express my appreciation for cooperation as a
concept.</p>
<p>Being a <a href="/tag/opinion/the-greatest-value" title="The greatest value(s)">the greatest value</a> is clearly hyperbole, even before I write more
than one article using the superlative.  True greatestness was never the idiom,
but rather a way to express that this value should be used as an ethical rubric.
When another quality or virtue suggests a different decision, the titular value
should be chosen instead.  It&#39;s a thing that should be pursued along a general 
course of behavior.  It&#39;s just intrinsically a good thing.  That&#39;s what I&#39;m
going for here.</p>

    <p>Alternate title: from-scratch CSS misadventures in emulating print media; how I
learned to stop worrying and love css columns and flex-box.</p>
<p>After <a href="/under-construction-3/" title="blog under construction part 3 - what audience and why bespoke">being personally attacked</a> about building a blog instead of writing
content for it, I further <del>was dog-piled</del> felt seen by folks noting that it was
equally likely we&#39;d waste our time in style-sheets instead of making the platform.
So, so true.</p>
<p>But now being on the other side of that process, I&#39;m happy to have spent the 
effort.  I like the look and am excited to refine it further.  This article 
will introduce additional items that I need to style, and I&#39;m genuinely looking
forward to it.  Among those new features: the 3rd article on the home page (the
intended maximum number), block-quote-based large text blurbs, aside elements, 
and various inter-linking exercises like categories and prev/next relation links.<br>Huzzah!</p>
