<p>After waiting what feels like most of a lifetime, I finally made progress toward writing and publishing again.  I&#39;ve had the inspiration to start blogging again for a very, very long time, but like all projects in my recent adult life I have lost momentum before even starting.
The idea of writing has bounced around my head for even longer.  It was my first career ambition as a child, even.  That dream fell away in the face of STEM.  I experimented again in college amid my engineering studies, and I enjoyed the exercise a great deal.  But after google-analyzing a visitor that may have been a prospective employer, I thoughtlessly wiped all its contents.  The content was not valuable, but I regret the loss of the activity.
Today, I not only lack desperation to please some fickle interviewer but also seek to share some wisdom from the intervening fifteen years of labor.</p>
<h2 id="first-the-bikeshedding">First the bikeshedding</h2>
<p>Although literal typing of words is something I can do without hesitation, virtually anywhere and at any time, actually producing a website on which to write things inspires crippling analysis paralysis.  To self-title or cling to anonymity?  To focus on my profession (or other subject) or allow variety?  A gimmicky theme or a simple journal?  And of course the pinnacle of indecision, what title?</p>
<p>God save me, choosing a URL encompasses all the prior problems and more.</p>
<p>So for several months, I avoided all those issues entirely and simply took notes about topics.  If their collation answers the above questions, I thought, then I will be able to proceed.  This plan worked; the pattern I noticed was helpful.  </p>
<p>I like to be a real person and take responsibility for my ideas.  I do like to talk about my area of expertise; my objective level expertness doesn&#39;t really matter.  And I want to be able to discuss whatever subject occurs to me.  Most of all, I like to answer questions.  Hence my current domain name: personal, short, and accurately capturing the rhetorical style.</p>
<h2 id="knowing-the-url-is-half-the-battle">Knowing the URL is half the battle</h2>
<p>Acquiring a domain name is the other half.  Rounding out my 3rd decade on the internet, and my 2nd as a web professional, one might assume that I could register a domain with my eyes closed.  HAHAHAHA no.</p>
<p>Having had previous blogs, I did have preexisting domain registration and hosting, both via a longstanding and terrible provider.  The idea of working with that organization has been repugnant for longer than I can remember.  But fully extricating myself from their clutches was extremely difficult.  And finding new hosting is also surprisingly annoying in current world.  [future article: why modern turnkey hosting is bad][hosting]</p>
<p>Commercial giga-tech to the rescue.  Google offers service as a domain registrar, and like all their products they make it as straightforward as possible.  But it still takes days of waiting, which is usually outside my attention span.  Luckily I had been building commitment to this project literally for years.</p>
<p>New domain in hand, I still had to acquire new hosting.  Although I <em>could</em> spin up a server of my own, or use some godawful orchestration of cloud services, or purchase the aforementioned terrible consumer options, those all seemed like far more effort than I was willing and able to invest.  I wanted to write, not administer systems.</p>
<p>Luckily there are a plethora of options for hosted blogs as well.  But those also come with endless strings attached.  I want to be the owner of not just my writing but also the very files of that writing.  I did want to retain flexibility to exercise web dev if I felt so inclined, perhaps even write my own css.  Most importantly I want to write markdown, because formatting html by hand is another kind of tedium that gets in the way of writing.  That rules out most blog-as-a-service options and simple ftp.</p>
<p>Github to the rescue.  [Github pages][github-pages] they cover all my constraints about ownership and simplicity+flexibility, while <em>also</em> hosting the files for free.</p>
<p>Great.  Now on to the [small problem of generating those files][blogging with markdown].  Thanks for reading; welcome to my blog.</p>
